  "The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding: Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This pulls your brain out of 'anticipatory panic'.",
  "The 'Stop' Hand: Agree with your dentist that raising your left hand means 'pause immediately'. Knowing you are in total control of the pace reduces the feeling of being trapped.",
  "Temperature Reset: If you feel a wave of anxiety, ask for a cold compress or a sip of ice water. Sudden cold can 'reset' your nervous system's fight-or-flight response.",
  "Cognitive Reframing: Instead of thinking 'I am trapped', try 'I am in a safe clinical environment choosing to invest in my long-term health and comfort'.",
  "Audio Distraction: Use noise-canceling headphones with 'Pink Noise' or 'Brown Noise'. These frequencies are better than music at masking clinical sounds.",
  "Weighted Presence: Ask for an X-ray lead apron to be left on you during the procedure. The weight provides a grounding effect similar to a weighted blanket.",
  "Anesthesia Reality: Modern local anesthetics are incredibly precise. If you feel any sharpness, it's not a failure of the process—it just means more is needed. Speak up immediately.",
  "The Post-Visit Reward: Schedule a small, enjoyable activity for right after your appointment. Focusing on the 'finish line' provides a mental anchor during the procedure.",
  "Empowered Communication: Be specific with the staff. Say 'I am afraid of the sound' or 'I am afraid of needles'. They have specific protocols to help with each distinct fear.",
  "The Physiological Sigh: Take a deep breath in through the nose, followed by a tiny second 'sip' of air at the very top, then a long, slow exhale through the mouth."
